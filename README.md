# Seminar-work
Seminar work(or "Seminararbeit" in german) about building a GBM-Model for predicting diabetes. The project was a part of the "Seminar for Bachelor Statistics" course at
the University of Vienna, where I demonstrated the Gradient Boosting Machines Algorithm for building a model to predict, if a patient has diabetes or not.

The statistical methods used during the work are:

-Gradient Boosting Machines.
-Model evaluation criteria such as Sensivity, Specificity, False positive rate, False negative rate, Accuracy and ROC.
-Grid search method for optimizing the GBM hyperparameters.
